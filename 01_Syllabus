# Memory IC Syllabus & Roadmap

This folder contains the **structured learning roadmap** for Memory IC design.

## Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core IC Fundamentals (1–2 months)**
   - Digital IC design (CMOS, logic gates, flip-flops)
   - Analog fundamentals (MOSFET, current mirrors, differential pairs)
   - Tools: Verilog, SPICE simulations

2. **Phase 2: Memory Fundamentals (2–3 months)**
   - SRAM, DRAM architecture
   - Layout basics
   - Bitline/wordline drivers, sense amps

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Design & Optimization (2–3 months)**
   - Low-power & high-speed memory design
   - Timing closure, parasitic extraction
   - Automation with Python/TCL

4. **Phase 4: Research Topics (2–3 months)**
   - Emerging memories: MRAM, ReRAM, PCM
   - Memory reliability, soft errors, retention
   - Circuit-architecture co-design
